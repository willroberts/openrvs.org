### Download OpenRVS for clients and servers

Get the latest release from [Github](https://github.com/OpenRVS-devs/OpenRVS/releases), and follow the instructions there.

See the UnrealScript source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRVS-devs/OpenRVS).

### See all available servers

Since OpenRVS 1.5, servers self-register with a registry, which provides an automatically-updated server list at [https://openrvs.org/servers](https://openrvs.org/servers).

See the registry source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/willroberts/openrvs-registry).

### See currently active servers

There is a server list with player stats at [https://openrvs.org/live](https://openrvs.org/live).

See the stats page source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/willroberts/openrvs-stats).

### Talk to game servers over UDP

Game servers communicate over UDP using a "beacon" protocol.

See the beacon library source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/willroberts/openrvs-beacon).
